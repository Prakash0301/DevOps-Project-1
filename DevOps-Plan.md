ðŸ“š Month 4 Plan â€” CI/CD Fundamentals
Week 1: Understand CI/CD Concepts
Goal: Know what and why of CI/CD.

Continuous Integration (CI):

Developers push code frequently (daily or multiple times a day).

The system builds and tests automatically to catch problems early.

Continuous Deployment (CD):

Code that passes testing is automatically deployed to production (or staging).

Main Components of a CI/CD Pipeline:

Source Code Management (GitHub/GitLab)

Build (compile/code package)

Test (unit tests, security tests)

Deploy (push to server or container)

Week 2: Learn Jenkins OR GitHub Actions (Pick One First)
Option 1: Jenkins (Recommended if you want deep DevOps control)
Install Jenkins locally (or on a server).

Jenkins Concepts:

Jobs (Pipelines)

Freestyle Jobs vs Pipeline Jobs (declarative YAML syntax)

Important Jenkins plugins: Git, Docker Pipeline, Blue Ocean UI.

Practice:

Connect Jenkins to your GitHub repo.

Trigger a simple build when you push code.

Option 2: GitHub Actions (Recommended if you want fast setup)
GitHub Actions Concepts:

Workflows

Jobs

Steps

Practice:

Create a .github/workflows/main.yml file in your repo.

Set up a simple workflow that runs echo "Hello CI/CD" on each push.

Week 3: Learn Docker Basics
Goal: Understand how to package an app inside a container.

Install Docker locally.

Learn and practice:

docker build -t myapp . â€” build a Docker image.

docker run -d -p 8080:80 myapp â€” run the image as a container.

docker ps, docker images, docker logs, docker stop.

Create a simple Dockerfile for an app (example: Nginx, simple Python app).

Mini-Practice:

Dockerize a small app (like a static HTML page or a Python Flask app).

Week 4: Set up a Full Pipeline (Build â†’ Test â†’ Deploy)
Use Jenkins or GitHub Actions to:

Clone code from GitHub.

Build the Docker image.

Run unit tests (if available).

Push Docker image to Docker Hub (optional).

Deploy the Docker container to a local server.

Example Simple Pipeline Steps:

Checkout the code (Git clone).

Build the Docker image.

Run tests inside the container.

Deploy (run container on server).

ðŸ›  End of Month Mini-Project
âœ… Create a GitHub repository with a small app (HTML page or Python app).
âœ… Dockerize the app (create a Dockerfile).
âœ… Create a CI/CD pipeline:

Auto build on Git push.

Auto run a test (even a simple curl localhost test).

Auto deploy to a test server or local Docker.

ðŸ“‹ Tools & Commands Cheat Sheet

Task	Tool/Command
Create Docker Image	docker build -t appname .
Run Docker Container	docker run -d -p 8080:80 appname
Install Jenkins	apt install jenkins (Ubuntu)
GitHub Action Trigger	.github/workflows/main.yml
CI/CD Trigger	Push code to GitHub
âš¡ Important Advice
Don't spend weeks perfecting Jenkins or GitHub Actions.

Focus on making something small but working â€” then improve it.

Keep practicing â€” setting up 3-4 pipelines will make you very confident.

Would you also like me to give you a ready-to-use simple GitHub Actions workflow file + a simple Dockerfile example to get started even faster? ðŸš€

Let's now build your Month 5: Containers and Orchestration learning plan:

ðŸ“š Month 5 Plan â€” Containers (Docker) & Orchestration (Kubernetes)
Week 1â€“2: Docker Deep Dive
Goal: Be very comfortable building, running, managing containers.

Key Docker Concepts to Learn:
Images vs Containers

Image = Blueprint

Container = Running instance

Basic Commands:

Build image: docker build -t myapp .

Run container: docker run -d -p 8080:80 myapp

List containers: docker ps

Stop container: docker stop container_id

Remove container/image: docker rm, docker rmi

Dockerfile Basics:

Create a Dockerfile with:

dockerfile
Copy
Edit
FROM ubuntu:20.04
RUN apt update && apt install -y nginx
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
Docker Volumes (Persist data):

docker run -v /local/dir:/container/dir image

Docker Networks (Communication between containers):

docker network create mynetwork

docker run --network=mynetwork container

Mini-Practice Exercises:
âœ… Create a Dockerfile for a simple app.
âœ… Build and run it.
âœ… Use volumes to save data outside the container.
âœ… Create two containers that talk to each other (example: web + database).

Week 3â€“4: Introduction to Kubernetes (K8s)
Key Kubernetes Concepts:
What is Kubernetes:

A system to manage and orchestrate containers across many servers.

Important Objects:

Pod = smallest unit (runs 1 or more containers)

Service = exposes pods to the network (load balancing)

Deployment = manages replicas (how many pods should run)

kubectl (Command-line tool to interact with Kubernetes):

Install it locally.

Minikube (Simple local Kubernetes cluster):

minikube start

kubectl get nodes

Learn These Basic kubectl Commands:

Task	Command
See nodes	kubectl get nodes
Deploy app	kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
See pods	kubectl get pods
Describe pod	kubectl describe pod podname
Delete deployment	kubectl delete deployment name
Mini-Practice Exercises:
âœ… Install Minikube locally.
âœ… Deploy a simple app (like Nginx) to Kubernetes using a YAML file.
âœ… Create a Service to expose your app (LoadBalancer or NodePort).
âœ… Scale your Deployment (e.g., from 1 to 3 replicas).

ðŸ›  End of Month Mini-Project
âœ… Dockerize a small web app.
âœ… Deploy the app into Kubernetes (on Minikube).
âœ… Expose it to the internet via a Kubernetes Service.

âš¡ Important Tip
ðŸ‘‰ Learn Docker properly first (weeks 1â€“2) â€” it will make Kubernetes 10Ã— easier.
